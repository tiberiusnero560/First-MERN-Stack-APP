<h1>First MERN Stack Application</h1>


I have broke down a tutorial to learn the MERN stack. I have been trying to really understand the React state and component lifecycle. How to create and reuse components, the use of props etc. 

My goal is to continue to expand this application with new functionality and custom functionality to make it my own and continue to learn more about React and become more comfortable with using it. I have become fairly comfortable with using Node.js and express to create the backend server and even using mongodb to create a database. I have created the schema with mongoose to structure the data, but I still feel I will have to look things up for that, I know what to do but there are many steps that have to be done. 

I still need to write the code more often to understand it fully and be able to implement it quickly, but I have become fairly comfortable with implementing the basic GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE requests.

I will update this with a more structured description as I learn.
